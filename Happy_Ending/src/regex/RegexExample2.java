/*
Problem Statement:

You are tasked with developing a Java program that demonstrates the comprehensive usage of the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package. Your program should take a text input and perform the following operations using regular expressions:

1. Compile a regular expression pattern based on user input.
2. Create a `Matcher` object using the compiled pattern.
3. Perform matching operations using various methods of the `Matcher` class, such as `matches()`, `find()`, and `group()`.
4. Utilize methods like `start()` and `end()` to identify the start and end positions of matching substrings.
5. Implement a replacement mechanism using `replaceAll()` and `appendReplacement()` methods.
6. Incorporate the `appendTail()` method to finalize the replacement process.

Your program should showcase a thorough understanding of the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes, covering their major functionalities. Provide appropriate user prompts and error handling mechanisms to ensure a smooth interaction with the program.
